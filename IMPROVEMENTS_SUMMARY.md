## 8. Discussion Section Enhancements

### 8.1 Key Points to Address

1. **Why Federated Outperforms Centralized**:
   - Diverse threat patterns across clients
   - Regularization effect from distributed training
   - Trust-weighted aggregation filters poor updates

2. **Explainability Insights**:
   - DoS attacks: Network-level features dominate (packet rates, connection counts)
   - Cryptojacking: Kernel-level features critical (CPU usage, context switches)
   - Reconnaissance: Long-term patterns in port scans

3. **Byzantine Attack Scenarios**:
   - Label flipping attacks detected by Krum
   - Model poisoning attacks mitigated
   - Trade-off: Krum vs. TWFA (use Krum when attacks suspected)

4. **Concept Drift Examples**:
   - New attack variants emerging mid-training
   - Network configuration changes
   - Seasonal traffic patterns

5. **Trust Score Analysis**:
   - Correlation between trust scores and client data quality
   - Impact of historical trust on convergence speed
   - Clients with higher trust converge faster

### 8.2 Limitations and Future Work

**Limitations**:
1. SHAP computation adds ~10% training time
2. Multi-resolution attention increases memory by 15%
3. Drift detection requires minimum 5 rounds of history
4. Krum can be conservative (may reject valid updates)

**Future Work**:
1. Extend to hierarchical federated learning (multi-tier EVSE operators)
2. Personalized federated models per operator
3. Real-world deployment with OCPP protocol integration
4. Cross-silo federated learning across countries/regions
5. Federated hyperparameter optimization
